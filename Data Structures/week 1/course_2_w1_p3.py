Problem 3 - Network packet processing simulation
Input: (s,n, [[i_0,p_0], [i_1,p_1],...,[i_(n-1), p_(n-1)]]])
-S: buffer size
-n: number of incoming packers
-[i, p]: i-time of arrival
         p-time it takes to process

Output:
Time it was processed (all integers)
-1 if it was dropped


Implementation:
create buffer, when new packet arrives pop everything in buffer that is already done, then add new packet if it is fine

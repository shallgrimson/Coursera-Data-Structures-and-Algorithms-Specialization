Problem 3 - Quick Sort Improved
To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with
few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new
partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < ùë• part, = ùë• part, and > ùë• part.

#done by putting < x elements to the left of the array and if they = x put them at the end and move the pivot down one.  Then swap the elements that =x with those > x to \

Problem 6 - Closest Points
-Note that I did not do this one as I had to look at the Solution but notes about it:
Once len(points) <= 3 bruteforce to find the smallest d within those 2 or 3 points
The at most check 7 points is because you restrict x to within d and then sort Y.  From this sorted Y to start at index 0, thus all other points of Y are above this point (or below depending how the arr is sorted),
that means that there are at most 7 points that need to be checked as they are indisguishable when we restrict x within d and sort Y
